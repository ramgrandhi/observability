      # Gotcha!
      # Unfortunately, AWS CloudFormation only accepts the entire Step Function definition as a single-line JSON string,
      # hence, it is not very convenient to make changes to it in future if we do it that way.
      # To overcome this limiation, we are using Serverless Variables feature here by pre-processing a good-looking JSON into a single-line JSON with the help of dashboard.js.

      # Gotcha!
